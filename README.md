# electron-quick-start

This is a demo Electron + React App. No **create-react-app** needed, just simple setup for *Webpack + Babel*.
You need to use *git bash* for the `npm run clean` script.

## To Use

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/raoul2000/electron-react-app.git
# Go into the repository
cd electron-react-app
# Install dependencies
npm install
```
From that point you can use the NPM script configured.
```bash
# run webpack dev server
bpm run dev-server

# when *dev server* is up, open a new console and start electron:
npm start
```

You can also build a distribuable package :
```bash
$ npm run electron-build
```
